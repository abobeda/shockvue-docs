# Remix images

This is an **experimental feature** that can **combine two input images** to create a new composition.

The tool is designed for artistic and creative blends rather than precise editsâ€”it's not intended for exact object placement. This means it's still not fully perfect for dressing people in clothes or accessories. For best results, use it with people or objects as subjects in new images. 

Check the examples below:

<Frame caption="Input image">
  ![Woman](/images/w.webp)
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Remix image">
  ![Miami](/images/miami.jpg)
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Place the woman in the city background">
  ![Woman](/images/generated-image-Put-the-woman-in-the-city-back.jpeg)
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Input image">
  ![Woman](/images/w.webp)
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Remix image">
  ![Robin Action Figure Jpe](/images/robin-action-figure.jpeg)
</Frame>

<Frame caption="The woman is holding the action figure">
  ![Woman](/images/generated-image-the-woman-is-holding-the-actio.jpeg)
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Input image">
  ![Robin Action Figure Jpe](/images/robin-action-figure.jpeg)
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Remix image">
  ![Miami](/images/city.jpg)
</Frame>

<Frame caption="Put the small action figure in the ground of the city background">
  ![Woman](/images/generated-image-Put-the-small-action-figure-in.jpeg)
</Frame>

**Utilizing the Remix Image Feature in Shockvue:**

To activate the Remix image feature, ensure you have uploaded two images.

**Input Image:** This is the first image you upload to the platform using Smart Edit.

**Remix image:** This is the second image uploaded via the "Remix image" button in the input form.

**What the feature is actually good for:**

- Creative composition
- Image combination
- Artistic fusion
- Scene blending

**Not that good for:**

- Precise object placement
- Product placement
- Exact positioning

<Tip>
  To achieve optimal results, experiment with a batch size of 2 to 4 images when using this feature iteratively.
