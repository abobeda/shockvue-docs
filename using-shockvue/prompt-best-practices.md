# Prompt Best Practices

### Best Practices Summary <a href="#best-practices-summary" id="best-practices-summary"></a>



* **Be specific**: Precise language gives better results. Use exact color names, detailed descriptions, and clear action verbs instead of vague terms.
* **Start simple**: Begin with core changes before adding complexity. Test basic edits first, then build upon successful results. Shockvue can handle very well iterative editing, use it.
* **Preserve intentionally**: Explicitly state what should remain unchanged. Use phrases like _“while maintaining the same \[facial features/composition/lighting]”_ to protect important elements.
* **Iterate when needed**: Complex transformations often require multiple steps. Break dramatic changes into sequential edits for better control.
* **Name subjects directly**: Use “the woman with short black hair” or “the red car” instead of pronouns like “her”, “it,” or “this” for clearer results.
* **Use quotation marks for text**: Quote the exact text you want to change: `Replace 'joy' with 'BFL'` works better than general text descriptions.
* **Control composition explicitly**: When changing backgrounds or settings, specify _“keep the exact camera angle, position, and framing”_ to prevent unwanted repositioning.
* **Choose verbs carefully**: _“Transform”_ might imply complete change, while _“change the clothes”_ or _“replace the background”_ gives you more control over what actually changes.

**Remember**: Making things more explicit never hurts if the number of instructions per edit isn’t too complicated.
